# Welcome to Object Oriented Programming (in JS)

In this tutorial, we will delve into the world of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a fundamental programming paradigm that structures software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. OOP allows for the creation of modular, reusable, and more manageable code, making it a vital concept in modern programming.

We will cover the following topics:

1. **How to create new objects** - Learn the various ways to instantiate new objects in JavaScript.
2. **How to define a class** - Understand the syntax and structure of defining a class in JavaScript.
3. **Class properties** - Explore how to define and use properties within a class to store information.
4. **The class constructor** - Get to know the constructor method, a special function that is called when creating an instance of a class.
5. **Practice objects** - Apply the concepts learned through hands-on exercises to reinforce your understanding.
